- What was your motivation?
I wanted to challenge myself and see if i can do something complex as this project.

We see different quizes all the time and i thought would be fun building one

It's not a problem solving quiz.it simply asks a few questions about the things that we learn through first month of school and gives you multiple choices answers

- What did you learn?
I honestly learned a lot.i learned more about Java though i still struggle with it. it is so complex and broad .
i also learned that you dont know how some things work and are built untill you do it yourself!
